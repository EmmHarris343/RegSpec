# RegSpec
An old Minecraft plugin I made for Region Specific Permissions

This plugin utilized 2 plugins, vault and worldguard,

### How it worked
This used zones declared in worldguard, and took the flags of the zone. It was originally designed so you could fly, run around, have super sprint etc granted to you through permissions. Soon as you enter a PVP zone lets say, it would drop all those things that would give you an unfair advantage. And when you exited those zones it would grant them back.

Another example would be, you have a surivival based world. But at the spawn you could fly to see the super fancy looking starting Zone. Once you left the starting zone area it would drop the flying permission. 

I finished the plugin, it worked well but sadly the server died I was working on this addon for.
